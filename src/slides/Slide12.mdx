## Reducers

#### What is a reducer?

Reducing two things into one thing
```jsx
let array = [1,2,3,4,5]
let add = (x, y) => x + y
array.reduce(add, 0) // 15
```

In react, we would have some state and actions
```jsx
let initialState = {
	count: 0,
	user: {}
}

let actions = [
	{ type: 'ADD', by: 2 },
	{ type: 'MINUS', by: 4 },
]

function reducer(state, action) {
	if (action.type === 'ADD') {
		return { ...state, count: state.count + action.by }
	} else if ( action.type === 'MINUS') {
		return { ...state, count: state.count - action.by }
	}

	return state
}
```

export default ({ children }) => <Layout title="React Training">{ children }</Layout>
